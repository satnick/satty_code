This problem is based on the fact when XOR is applied to set of numbers with duplicates numbers, duplicate number in pairs cancel out.
But two numbers are unique so doing XOR will give XOR of two unique numbers.
To identify both, find the first set bit in the xor. First we can take from right.

  Now xor all the numbers of array which has same bit set at the position where first bit is set to filter out the first number.
  Xor other numbers of array where the bit is not set at the position which is found above.

  ex:
    
  arr: [1,2,1,3,2,5]
    in bit representation, it is 
    1 => 0001 (we can represent in 32 bits but for simplicity keeping 4 bits only)
    2 => 0010
    1 => 0001
    3 => 0011
    2 => 0010
    5 => 0101
  
  xor of arr: 1^2^1^3^2^5 => 3^5 => 0110

  so resultant xor is 0110

  in the resultant XOR 0110, 1 appears means bits are different in this position for two numbers which can be anyone. To identify it find the first set bit in resultant xor.
  in 0110, first bit set is at position 2 from right.

  Find all the numbers of array whose bit is set at position 2 from right . They are 2,3,2. Their bit representation is 0010, 0011, 0010. Take xor of it. so result will be 3
  Find all numbers of array whose bit is not set at postion at 2 from right. They are 1,1,5. In bit representation, these are 0001,0001,0101. Take xor of these, so result is 5

  Got the result as 3 and 5.
