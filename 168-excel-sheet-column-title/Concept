Solution to this problem:

When column number exceeds 26, next sequence of A, B.. starts. So its in multiple of 26. Certainly mod 26 would be used.
Only case that need to be taken care is if n is 26, 26%26 would be 0 for Z. To handle the mod scenario so that 1 would be A, remainder should be reduced by 1.
Sequence will go from 0 to 25. 
'A' + n%26 will give right character.
'A' + 0 => 'A' (0 is obtained when n=1, i.e. n-1%26)
'A' + 25 => 'Z' (when n=26, n-1%26 = 25, so Z is result)

So every time remainder is reduced by one to get the exact value. 

if n = 28, reduce n = n-1, (n-1)% 26 = 1 => 'A' + 1 => 'B'
Now n = n/26 => 1 => reduce it by 1, n = 0 => 'A' + 0 => 'A'
So string form is BA, which needs to be reversed, so final result is AB
